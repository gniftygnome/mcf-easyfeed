# mcf-easyfeed (minecraft mod) Easy feeding and breeding for fabric

Throw food at animals to feed them and breed them.

They would not actively search for food around them, but all animals that can be tempted by food can pick it and eat
from the ground.

Bees, Chicken, Cats, Cows, Horses, Donkeys, Llamas, Ocelots, Pigs, Rabbits, Sheep, Turtles and Wolves should work.
It can also work for animals from other mods (depends on how they are implemented). If you find anything failing or
missing drop a comment or create an issue on github.

Have fun!

P.S. This is another mod created after "Dad, my mod is no longer working in 1.15.2! Can't you fix it?!"
Going through Goals code for different animals I found out that Foxes and Pandas seem more intelligent and definitely
live more healthy and interesting life than the villagers ;)
