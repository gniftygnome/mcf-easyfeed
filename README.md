# mcf-easyfeed (minecraft mod) Easy feeding and breeding for fabric

Throw food at animals to feed them and breed them.

They would not actively search for food around them, but all animals that can be tempted by food can pick it and eat from the ground.

Bees, Chicken, Cats, Cows, Horses, Donkeys, Llamas, Ocelots, Pigs, Rabbits, Sheep, Turtles and Wolves should work. 
It can also work for animals from other mods (depends on how they are implemented). If you find anything failing or missing drop a comment or create an issue on github.

Have fun!

P.S. This is another mod created after "Dad, my mod is no longer working in 1.15.2! Can't you fix it?!"
Going through Goals code for different animals I found out that Foxes and Pandas seem more intelligent and definitely live more healthy and interesting life than the villagers ;)

#### Change history

1.2.0 "attention" range for animals is now equal to the distance it which they notice players, they run that long to the food with the same speed as when tempted by a player

1.1.0 increased "attention reach" of animals, they also feed on food in blocks next to them

1.0.1 removed output to stdout in the handler, bumped up deps' versions

1.0.0 first version
